## Welcome to `Structural Equation Modeling with R` Shiny App!

Hello ! My name is Keon-Woong Moon. I am a Professor of Cardiology at Catholic University of Korea, South Korea. It's an honor and pleasure to introduce you my shiny app-`Structural Equation Modeling with R`.


## What this app aims

This app is for reseachers, students or professors who want to perform structural equation modeling(sem). With this app, you can perform `structural equation modeling` with `just one-click`. You can perform the `confirmatory factor analysis`, fit a `structural equation model`, fit a `growth curve model`, and fit a `partial least square(PLS) model`. Additionally, you can obtain beautiful plots in png, svg or pdf format. You can download the results with html or PDF format. You can also download the powerpoint file with `just one click`.  

## What you need for this app

All you need for this app is a modern web browser supporting HTML5(chrome, opera, safari and ...). `No R installation` is required. `No LaTex` installation is required. This app is independent of operating system of your computer. Windows, Mac and Linux PCs are all compatible. You can use even `a tablet PC` or `a smartphone`.


## Which Sever is available

At present, I maintained six servers. You can choose any server among followings. Please find the nearest server and ejoy the app.

## Othe Apps created by web-r.org

You can find other useful apps created by me. One of these, you can perform meta-analysis by the mata app.

## Coming soon
 
Other apps including web-based `ggplot2` app and web-based `analysis using R` will be available soon.
